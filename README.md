# MUFON UFO Journal

Previously called Skylook, [MUFON UFO Journal](https://mufon.com/mufon-journal/) is the official newsletter of Mutual UFO Network.

The Mutual UFO Network, a.k.a. MUFON, was born shortly before the US Air Force exited the public UFO investigative universe. The University of Colorado’s Scientific Study of Unidentified Flying Objects by Dr. Edward U. Condon in 1969 gave the Air Force the perfect excuse to end its Project Blue Book when Dr. Condon stated in his report “that we do not see any fruitful lines of advance from the study of UFO reports.” His research had found “no reason to question” the presumption that UFO reports do “not pose a defense problem.” However, the report had glossed over obvious evidence for UFOs being a genuine unknown phenomenon and had come to a predetermined conclusion before any investigation was ever undertaken.

The Midwest UFO Network, the organization created by Walt Andrus and John Schuessler in 1969, went on to become the Mutual UFO Network, covering initially the United States and today the world in its investigations of UFO events in all times, in all places. Its motto—“Doing the Air Force’s Job Since 1969!”—sums up the organization’s raison d’être.

MUFON is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization dedicated to investigating and researching reports of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) and extraterrestrial encounters. Our mission is to utilize the scientific method to find an answer to this eons-old problem for the benefit of humanity!

MUFON consists of over 6,000 members and is the largest “functioning” membership organization in the world dedicated to UFO research. We have over 600 field investigators worldwide investigating UFO reports. These dedicated investigators come from a wide range of professional disciplines including biology, geology, photo analysis, and information technology and comprise commercial airline pilots, retired special ops soldiers, retired police detectives, astronomers, statisticians, journalists, and a bevy of other specialties. We are not amateurs by any means as our detractors would like the public to believe. However, MUFON is, to our great credit, an all-volunteer agency. This allows us to remain a free, transparent voice unhindered by the influence of private corporations or the government.
 
MUFON’s core mission is to utilize the Scientific Method to unravel the mystery of the UFO Phenomenon. This special July 2023 Issue of our monthly magazine is devoted to who we are as an organization and what we do to unravel the UFO enigma. We are offering it FREE to the public to raise awareness as to our fundamental mission!

In these pages, which have been published without interruption since 1969, you will learn how we operate as a non-profit grassroots organization on a day-to-day basis, how we investigate UFOs with highly trained volunteer investigators, how we maintain a database of 132,000 UFO cases, how we find, test, and qualify our Field Investigators, and use our state-of-the-art laboratory to analyze trace evidence among other ventures we undertake with incredible enthusiasm.
 
In addition to a well-produced monthly Journal with cutting edge articles, we also have a twice monthly newsletter frequently showcasing a case of interest, a member’s only social network called the Observer Network, and a Map App for free to members and at a price in the Google and Apple App stores for non- members which lays out our 132,000 cases in a beautiful global format.

We also produce the MUFON What’s Up radio show on the KGRA Digital Broadcasting Network, produce our own YouTube programs, provide premium members our own television network programming called MUFON TV. We even have a movie out currently called “An Accidental Truth!”
